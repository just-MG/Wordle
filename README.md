# Wordle

Wordle is a popular guessing game that requires you to guess a 5-letter word each day. It is unbelivabely simple, though extremally entertaining. I have decided it would be rather fun to create my own version of it - and here we are.

## How to play?

In order to play the game you need to download all the python files into one folder. Then, use terminal to switch to the folder in which the files are located and run the main file; namely use:

```zsh
python3 main.py
```

Now all you need to do is input your guesses, and the programme will output the board, just like in the regular version of the game. At the end you get to choose whether you want to continue playing or just end the session.
